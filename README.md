# Unet_with_VAE

## Overview
Unet_with_VAE is a deep learning framework that integrates U-Net, a convolutional neural network for image segmentation, with Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to enhance generalization through effective feature extraction and data augmentation. This project aims to improve the accuracy and robustness of medical image segmentation tasks, particularly focusing on echocardiographic images.

## Features
- **U-Net Architecture**: Utilizes the U-Net model for precise segmentation of medical images.
- **Variational Autoencoder**: Employs VAE for generating synthetic data that mimics the distribution of training data, thereby enhancing model robustness against overfitting.
- **Cross-device Compatibility**: Tests the model's effectiveness across different medical imaging devices.
